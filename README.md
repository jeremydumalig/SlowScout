# SlowScout

## Shot Plotter Data Storage

### Google Sheets Integration
Data is stored in a public Google Sheet - no authentication required.

**Sheet:** [SlowScout Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1URS4hxvfRXtf_kqDnFoyrRCE8ETlhBlN3J0MPdUlXTw)

### Required Setup
1. Make sure the Google Sheet is set to **"Anyone with the link can edit"**
2. Create three tabs named exactly: `shots`, `events`, `turnovers`

### How It Works
- Every shot/event is written to Google Sheets in real-time
- Data persists forever
- View/export data anytime from the spreadsheet
